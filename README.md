# SentinelCare: Advanced AI Fall Detection System

## Overview

SentinelCare is an advanced AI-powered fall detection system utilizing pose estimation techniques to identify and alert for falls in real time. This system is designed for use in healthcare facilities, elderly care homes, and smart surveillance applications to enhance safety and response times.

## Features

- **Real-Time Fall Detection**: Uses pose estimation models to identify abnormal postures indicative of falls.
- **High Accuracy**: Implements state-of-the-art deep learning models such as OpenPose, BlazePose, or MediaPipe Pose.
- **Edge & Cloud Deployment**: Works on edge devices like Raspberry Pi or cloud-based solutions for scalable applications.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Sends alerts via email, SMS, or IoT-integrated platforms (e.g., AWS, Firebase, MQTT).
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjustable thresholds for fall detection to reduce false positives.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Uses skeletal representation instead of raw video footage to ensure privacy.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - OpenPose / MediaPipe / BlazePose
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy, Pandas
  - Flask / FastAPI (for API integration)
  - MQTT / Firebase / Twilio (for alerts)

## System Architecture

1. **Video Input**: Live camera feed or pre-recorded video.
2. **Pose Estimation Model**: Extracts skeletal keypoints from the video.
3. **Fall Detection Algorithm**:
   - Checks body orientation, velocity, and impact detection.
   - Uses machine learning classifiers (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM) for improved accuracy.
4. **Alert System**: Notifies caregivers through SMS, email, or IoT integration.
5. **Dashboard (Optional)**: Web-based UI for monitoring fall events in real time.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dr-irshad/SentinelCare-Advanced-AI-Fall-Detection-System.git
cd SentinelCare-Advanced-AI-Fall-Detection-System

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the System

```sh
# Run the detection script
python fall_detection.py --input video.mp4

# Run in real-time mode
python fall_detection.py --live
```

## API Integration

Run the API for external applications:

```sh
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
